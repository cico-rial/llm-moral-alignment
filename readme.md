General rule: clone repo, **create your own branch**, possibly work on separate file at this stage.  
I would suggest to copy the notebook files with your own version or create new ones.  
## how to set up:
- clone repo;
- create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.
- i personally prefer to use `uv` as a venv.
- after creating a venv, install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
**note**: i created a file containing the requirements with the version of `trl` having the `step()` method. Install that if you want to try to fix our problem.
